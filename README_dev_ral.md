===============

Using a Tibber Pulse on an Aidon HAN interface I got problems with elwiz.js:
    The calculation of the "buf" length was in error.
    New code is verified.

I have also made a comment in the aidon.js file where I would like to have the calculation
on a L3-list to be optional..
What about having a setting in configuration.yaml to seect if the calculation should be performed ??
